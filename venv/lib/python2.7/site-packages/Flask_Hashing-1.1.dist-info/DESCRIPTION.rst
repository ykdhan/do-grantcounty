Flask-Hashing
-------------

This is a Flask extension that provides utility functions
for hashing data within a Flask application.

Flask-Bcrypt restricts you to using bcrypt. What if you want
to use a different hash function? This extension provides access
to other commonly used hash functions such as SHA256.
